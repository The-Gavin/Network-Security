Task I
2. Because if we enable UFW with no rules, we won't be able to connect to our server through SSH.
7. The fact that the server is active and that the ports I've specified are allowed in from anywhere.
8. sudo ufw deny from 10.0.0.0
9. sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.50 to any port 587. This port is used for email submissions.

Task II
3. It will let us know the IP Address of the device causing traffic, and what port it is causing traffic on, as well as whether or not it is currently blocked.
5. No, because I have not denied any IP Addresses access during this use of the terminal.
